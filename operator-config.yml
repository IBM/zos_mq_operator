  # IBM Z and Cloud Modernization Stack - MQ Resources Operator
    The **IBM MQ Resources Operator Collection** allows users to manage MQ local and alias queues, and server connection channel resources 
    on an IBM MQ for z/OS Queue Manager. The Queue Manager may be an existing Queue Manager on a z/OS LPAR, or a Queue Manager that has been
    installed from an ADCD image in a Wazi Sandbox. Queue Manager **CSQ9** is pre-created with a **Command Prefix of %CSQ9** in an ADCD image.
    Users can start this Queue Manager (%CSQ9 START QMGR) and the corresponding Channel Initiator (%CSQ9 START CHINIT) if required.
  # Input
    Depending on the type of MQ resource being created only a minimum set of attributes are required as input:
    - a Queue Manager Command Prefix
    - a Queue or Channel Name
    - a Description for the Queue or Channel being created
    - an optional LIKE object name
  # Limitations
    Only a few MQ Resource Types are currently supported. Depending on user requirements, other resource types may be considered in the future.
  # Version
    1.0.0

# A base64-encoded icon unique to the Operator
icon:
  #  The based64-encoded image string for the IBM MQ icon.
